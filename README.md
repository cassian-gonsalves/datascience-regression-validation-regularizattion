# Assignment-2 Data Science - Linear Models

In the above notebook I have generated Linear Model based on the data to predict the quality of wine based on its attributes like density, acidity etc. I have used linear regression, logistic regression to check the accuracy of the predictions. Further, I have Checked for multi-colinearity and perform step-wise regression along with regularization. The notebook also consists of Data Visualization techniques where in the data is explored and its statistics can be viewed.
